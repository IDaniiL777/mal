Detecting bad stuff.
So, how do we detect bad stuff?

If powershell is not used in your environment â€“ look for any signs of powershell usage, such
as Prefetch files, powershell processes, shim cache entries of powershell etc. Also look for
wsmprovhost process in addition to powershell.

Another option would be monitoring for a new processes that run powershell with -enc option,
since there is not much legitimate usage of encoded scripts that I know of, this will be
highly suspicious. On the other hand every malicious payload I saw was in form of base64
encoded script.
