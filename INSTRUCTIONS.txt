To build a cuckoo sandbox please follow these steps.

1. Install either Kali rolling or Ubuntu 14 LTS on a box not a vm.  The reason you don’t
want to install on vm is because cuckoo gets confused when you run the virtualbox vm inside
another vm. I tend to prefer Kali.

2. Run the prep.sh script. This will install the dependencies you will need going forward.

3. Run the mal.sh script this will pull latest github versions of volatility yara etc.

4. cd /opt/cuckooautoinstall and do bash *.bash. This will install cuckoo v2.-dev. Now this
is not the very latest version of cuckoo (which is 2.0 RC1). I’ve submitted a ticket on
their github to update it to RC1. The dev version should get you started. It will also
install virtualbox.

5. copy yara-install.sh into /opt/yara and run it and do make, make install.

6. copy volatility-install.sh into /opt/volatility and run it and do make make install.

Above two steps will give you latest latest versions of these tools.

NOTE: I’ve included cuckoo-current.tar in the mal directory. This is the latest RC1 version
of cuckoo. I’ve included it just for completeness. Just use the version the autoinstall
script installs at first.

NOTE: create, configure and launch the virtualbox Windows VM BEFORE you launch cuckoo (by
running cuckoo.py ). The autoinstall script will create a user cuckoo and drop the cuckoo
directory in that user’s home directory. You run cuckoo by su’ing to cuckoo && cd ~/cuckoo
and ./cuckoo.py there.
